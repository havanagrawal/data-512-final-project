 * Are there any unknowns or dependencies that might affect your ability to complete this project?
 * How do human-centered design considerations inform your decision to pursue this project, and your approach to performing the work?

 **What type of data and analysis?**
 * Must use publicly-available and appropriately licensed dataset(s)
 * Can be a ‘classic’ statistical analysis, or the design and evaluation of a machine learning model
 * Use your own definition of ‘big data’!
 * Choose datasets and analyses that are likely to support reproducibility
 * Choose datasets and methods that let you answer questions that you find interesting and important
 * Visualizations aren’t necessary, but encouraged as an effective way of communicating your findings
