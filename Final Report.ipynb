    "Gender diversity has always been an area of interest for human-centered studies, and one that has been well-explored. However, the idea of evaluating gender diversity, and representation of minorities and/or marginalized communities in fiction has gained traction only in the past few years (\\[1\\], \\[2\\], \\[3\\], \\[4\\]). With increasing focus on better representation, it is important to make sure that we are making progress on all fronts.\n",
    "\n",
    "One rather well-known test for evaluating women representation in fiction is the [Bechdel test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bechdel_test). It asks whether _at least two women who talk to each other about something other than a man._\n",
    "\n",
    "The test is ambiguous in many regards, and indeed, the results are known to vary depending on how rigorously the test is applied. If we use the definition as \"at least one such conversation\", then the bar is too low, and allows a lot of works to pass the test even if they have poor women representation. On the other hand, if a long, meaningful conversation between two women just happens to mention a man in passing, it shouldn't invalidate the entire exchange.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further, there have definitely been attempts to automate the test (\\[5\\], \\[6\\]). However, these agree that:\n",
    "1. It is challenging to claim with high confidence whether or not a piece of fiction passes the test, often because of varying levels of rigor can alter the result\n",
    "2. No methodology exists for performing this test at scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, I attempt to analyze popular 19th century works of literature w.r.t. the Bechdel test. I hope to answer two primary questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "**RQ1: Do popular works of literature pass the Bechdel test, and to what extent?**  \n",
    "**RQ2: What gaps exist in current tools, techniques and methodologies that may hinder us from answering sociological questions such as this one, at scale?**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the process, I wish to validate the following hypothesis:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Even with the current state-of-the-art, It is inadvisable to try to scale sociological tests such as the Bechdel test using complete automation and/or machine learning. Instead, an iterative, interactive and qualitative analysis for each novel needs to be performed, due to the many nuances of a test such as this.**"

Whether it is fictional, biographical or historical, a good novel captivates you, pulls you from the physical realm into itself. Further still, I believe that works of fiction often captures the true nature of society. They either reflect on the world, as it is, or what it might become. Either consciously or subconsciously, the worlds created by a writer capture their perspective. \n",

Thus it is important to have the ability to evaluate works of fiction for the presence of bias."

    "> Among Shakespeare's plays, \"Hamlet\" is considered by many his masterpiece. Among actors, the role of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, is considered the jewel in the crown of a triumphant theatrical career. Now Kenneth Branagh plays the leading role and co-directs a brillant ensemble performance. Three generations of legendary leading actors, many of whom first assembled for the Oscar-winning film \"Henry V\", gather here to perform the rarely heard complete version of the play. This clear, subtly nuanced, stunning dramatization, presented by The Renaissance Theatre Company in association with \"Bbc\" Broadcasting, features such luminaries as Sir John Gielgud, Derek Jacobi, Emma Thompson and Christopher Ravenscroft. It combines a full cast with stirring music and sound effects to bring this magnificent Shakespearen classic vividly to life. Revealing new riches with each listening, this production of \"Hamlet\" is an invaluable aid for students, teachers and all true lovers of Shakespeare - a recording to be treasured for decades to come."

    "1. We only use the genders of speakers, and ignore the gender of names which occur in `people` but not in `gender_dict`. To make the notebook more precise, we could either try to infer the gender of various entities from the context of the novel, or fill them in manually.\n",
    "2. We consider **only binary genders**, and treat others as neutral, which do not contribute to the custom Bechdel score.\n",
    "3. The StanfordNER algorithm often **performs poorly at attributing speech** to the correct speaker. In cases where the gender of the speaker is different, this can affect the results significantly. The best way to evaluate the performance of the algorithm in a quantitative context would be to annotate a novel manually, and measure how much the results differ from the algorithm's."

    "We observe that most novels appear to have more than twice as many males as females, with Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice being a notable exception. Further, they appear to be slightly biased towards male-centric conversations; indeed, Hamlet turns out to have only a handful of conversations between females, which speaks volumes.\n",

    "While this research is neither novel nor groundbreaking, it highlights that even state-of-the-art NLP fall short of providing a competent tool box for performing large scale sociological studies such as this."
